# eCommerce Admin App

This is the admin panel for my eCommerce app, built using modern Android technologies. It allows you to manage products, monitor orders, and receive real-time notifications â€” all through a clean and responsive interface.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Dagger-Hilt** for dependency injection
- **Firebase Firestore** to store product and order data
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** to receive order notifications
- **Cloudinary** to store images instead of Firebase Storage (to avoid Spark plan limits)
- **MVVM Architecture** for clean, structured code
- **ViewBinding** to simplify UI handling
- **Navigation Component** to move smoothly between screens
- **BottomNavigation** for easy screen access
- **SharedPreferences** for saving theme and language preferences
- **SwitchCompat** to toggle between:
  - **Dark/Light mode**
  - **Arabic/English language**
- **Push Notifications** for new orders
- **Realtime Firestore Listeners** for live updates

---

## Features

- **Add New Products** â€“ with name, description, price, category, and image URL
- **Edit Products** directly from the product list
- **Order Management** â€“ see all orders and their details in real-time
- **Push Notifications** â€“ receive alerts for every new order
- **Theme Switching** â€“ toggle between dark and light mode
- **Language Switching** â€“ switch between Arabic and English
- **Fragment-based Navigation** using Navigation Graph
- **Clean and Simple UI** with responsive layout

## Learning & Customization

I started learning this app from the **Land of Coding** YouTube channel. The course wasnâ€™t completed, so I took the initiative to finish the admin app on my own, adding new features and improving its usability.

## Upcoming Improvements

- Adding a **map selection feature** for customer address management
- More detailed **order analytics** for admin insight
